Assignment operators
--------------------
An assignment operator in JavaScript is used to assign a value to a variable. The most basic assignment operator is the equals sign (=), but there are several other assignment operators that combine assignment with arithmetic or bitwise operations. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview:
1. Basic Assignment Operator
2. Compound Assignment Operators


Basic Assignment Operator or  Assignment (=)
--------------------------------------------
Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
    
let x = 5; // Assigns the value 5 to the variable x


Compound Assignment Operators
-----------------------------
These operators combine an arithmetic operation with assignment. They modify the variable's value based on the result of the operation.

1. Addition Assignment (`+=`)
-----------------------------
Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

let a = 5;
a += 3; // Equivalent to a = a + 3
console.log(a); // Outputs: 8


2. Subtraction Assignment (`-=`)
--------------------------------
Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

let a = 5;
a -= 2; // Equivalent to a = a - 2
console.log(a); // Outputs: 3


3. Multiplication Assignment (`*=`)
-----------------------------------
Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

let a = 4;
a *= 3; // Equivalent to a = a * 3
console.log(a); // Outputs: 12


4. Division Assignment (`/=`)
-----------------------------
Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

let a = 12;
a /= 4; // Equivalent to a = a / 4
console.log(a); // Outputs: 3


5. Remainder Assignment (`%=`)
------------------------------
Computes the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

let a = 10;
a %= 3; // Equivalent to a = a % 3
console.log(a); // Outputs: 1


6. Exponentiation Assignment (`**=`)
------------------------------------
Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

let a = 2;
a **= 3; // Equivalent to a = a ** 3
console.log(a); // Outputs: 8

*/

let a = 10;
let b = 3;

// 1. Addition Assignment
a += b;
console.log(a);

// Subtraction Assignment
a -= b;
console.log(a);

// 3. Multiplication Assignment
a *= b;
console.log(a);

// 4. Division Assignment
a /= b;
console.log(a);

// 5. Remainder Assignment
a %= b;
console.log(a);

// 6. Exponentiation Assignment
a **= b;
console.log(a);
