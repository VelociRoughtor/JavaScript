*               Variables             *
***************************************

1. Variable Declaration:

Syntax : var variable_name ;

2. Variable Initialization:

Syntax : variable_name = data;

if data is a string write " " between these. using ' ' is also fine. 
else if its a number write number(integer or float)
else its a boolean type data write true/false

example: 

*/

// var firstName;
// firstName = "Steven";

// if we combine both:

var firstName = "Steven";

// we can write let instead of var 

let lastName = "Han";

// '=' is called assignment operator.


// Variable naming rules: Reserved keyword can't be named as a variable
// We use camelCase Notation for naming variable.

// To print the output we use:

console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);
